## Introduction to FoxxBot

FoxxBot is an automated trading bot built for the QL1 blockchain, executing trades exclusively on QSwap. Designed for high-frequency trading, it focuses on maximizing profitability while maintaining a deflationary mechanism through a structured buyback and burn system.

FoxxBot operates on the **Wqom/QUSDT trading pair**, targeting 4% profit per trade. It continuously monitors market trends, adjusting its strategy based on Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and other trading parameters.

Managed and operated exclusively by **FoxxOne**, FoxxBot supports the deflationary supply of $Wqom while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the FoxxOne validator, RPC node, and dApp node infrastructure.

## Profit Distribution & Burn Mechanism

FoxxBot employs a structured profit distribution model to ensure sustainable trading operations while actively contributing to the deflationary model of $Wqom.

### Profit Allocation

- **Capital Wallet (75%)** ‚Äì Used to reinvest into trading, maintaining liquidity and increasing trade volume.
- **Burn Wallet (25%)** ‚Äì Profits allocated to this wallet are used for buyback and burn of $Wqom, reducing the circulating supply over time.

### Planned Increase in Burn Allocation

To further strengthen the deflationary pressure on $Wqom, FoxxBot‚Äôs profit allocation to the Burn Wallet will gradually increase over time. The distribution will shift from **75% capital / 25% burn** to an equal **50/50 split**, ensuring a greater percentage of trading profits are allocated toward buyback and burn.

Additionally, during high-liquidity periods or special burn events, FoxxBot may adjust the allocation to **25% capital / 75% burn**, significantly accelerating the deflationary process. These strategic adjustments will be made based on market conditions and infrastructure sustainability needs.

### How the Burn Wallet Works

üî• **Automated Burn at 100 QUSDT**  
When the Burn Wallet accumulates 100 QUSDT, it automatically executes a buyback and burn, purchasing $Wqom from QSwap and permanently removing it from circulation.

üî• **Manual Burn via /burn Command**  
Additional manual burns can be executed as necessary to further reduce $Wqom supply.

## Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

### How DCA Works

FoxxBot‚Äôs **DCA functionality** enhances trading profitability by strategically averaging down the entry price of open trades. When conditions are met, the bot executes additional purchases on existing trades, improving the chances of hitting the sell target.

### Key Features of DCA

- **Trigger Conditions:** DCA is initiated when the price moves a set percentage away from the original buy price.
- **Controlled Buy Amounts:** The bot allocates a fraction of the original trade size for DCA buys, ensuring capital is preserved.
- **Maximum DCA Attempts:** A limit is set on the number of DCA attempts per trade to manage risk.
