The goal of this site is become a knowledge base for the Qom Network. 
A place where we can document all the information about the network, the tools, the projects, the community, etc.

- Anyone can contribute to this site, you can add new pages, edit existing ones, fix typos, etc. 
- You only need to know how to write markdown files, and how to use git.
- After you make a change, the site will be automatically updated, and you can see the changes live.

### The site is hosted on 2 places

Both are the same site, same content. But it's expected to have different home page each one.

- One cool meme chain wiki, for community on [qom.wiki](https://qom.wiki)
- Other will be profesional tech wiki, for new users or investors on [wiki.qom.network](https://wiki.qom.network)

#### Notes:

- Using 2 homepage views is an idea we had to customize separately for 2 different readers. But eventually we could keep only 1 view if it were convenient.
- Both homepages, as well as all content, are in a constant state of "Work In Progress", constantly correcting errors and evolving.
