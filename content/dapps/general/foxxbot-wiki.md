## Introduction to FoxxBot  

FoxxBot is an **automated trading bot** built for the **QL1 blockchain**, executing trades exclusively on **QSwap**. Designed for high-frequency trading, it focuses on maximizing **profitability while maintaining a deflationary mechanism** through a structured **buyback and burn system**.  

FoxxBot operates on the **Wqom/QUSDT** trading pair, targeting **4% profit per trade**. It continuously monitors market trends, adjusting its strategy based on **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** and other trading parameters.  

FoxxBot is managed and operated **exclusively by FoxxOne** to support the **deflationary supply of $Wqom**, while ensuring the **long-term sustainability** of the **FoxxOne validator, RPC node, and dApp node infrastructure**.

## Profit Distribution & Burn Mechanism  

FoxxBot employs a structured **profit distribution model** that ensures sustainable trading operations while actively contributing to the **deflationary model of $Wqom**.  

### Profit Allocation  
- **Capital Wallet (75%)** ‚Äì Used to reinvest into trading, maintaining liquidity and increasing trade volume.  
- **Burn Wallet (25%)** ‚Äì Profits allocated to this wallet are used for **buyback and burn** of **$Wqom**, reducing the circulating supply over time.  

### Planned Increase in Burn Allocation  

To further strengthen the **deflationary pressure on $Wqom**, FoxxBot‚Äôs **profit allocation to the Burn Wallet will gradually increase over time**. The distribution will shift from **75% capital / 25% burn** to an equal **50/50 split**, ensuring a greater percentage of trading profits are allocated toward buyback and burn.  

Additionally, during **high-liquidity periods** or special burn events, FoxxBot may adjust the allocation to **25% capital / 75% burn**, significantly accelerating the deflationary process. These strategic adjustments will be made based on **market conditions and infrastructure sustainability needs** to ensure FoxxOne operations continue running effectively.  

### How the Burn Wallet Works  

üî• **Automated Burn at 100 QUSDT**  
- When the **Burn Wallet** accumulates **100 QUSDT**, it **automatically** executes a **buyback and burn**, purchasing **$Wqom** from QSwap and permanently removing it from circulation.  

üî• **Manual Burn via `/burn` Command**  
- Additional manual burns can be executed as necessary to further reduce **$Wqom** supply.  

This system ensures **consistent burning activity**, gradually reducing the supply of **$Wqom**, which could enhance its long-term value.
